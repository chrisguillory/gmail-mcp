## Implementation Notes

### Recommended Implementation Order:
1. **Start with threads** - Fundamental to Gmail's conversation model
2. **Add state management** (star, archive, delete) - Essential user operations
3. **Implement draft management** - Complete the email lifecycle
4. **Add attachment support** - Critical for document workflows
5. **Then batch operations** - Performance at scale

### Technical Considerations:
- Thread management will require refactoring existing message-centric operations
- Batch operations need careful API quota management
- Push notifications require Google Cloud Pub/Sub setup
- Attachment handling needs security considerations (malware scanning, size limits)
